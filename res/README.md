# Final Project (Building Elevator System)

## About/Overview
The Building Elevator System is designed to simulate the operation of elevators in a building. The program allows users to observe multiple elevators moving between floors to handle requests. Users can interact with the simulation by making requests and control the system. 

## List of Features
1. Simulates the operation of multiple elevators in a building.
2. User interaction to request elevators and control the building system.
3. Customizable number of floors and elevators.
4. Real-time visualization of elevator movement, requests distribution, and system status.

## How To Run
1. **Running the Jar File:**
    - Double-click the `ElevatorBuildingProgram.jar` file.
    - Or execute the following command in the terminal: `java -jar ElevatorBuildingProgram.jar`

## How to Use the Program
- Upon running the program, a graphical interface will be displayed, showing a default building layout and elevator status.
- Users can interact with the simulation by:
    - Start, stop, step the building system.
    - Input 'from floor' and 'to floor', then use submit button to make one or multiple requests.
    - Observing elevator movements and operations in real-time.
    - Change to a new building by customizing the number of floors and elevators, as well as max occupancy, in the building.

## Design/Model Changes
**Version 1.0:**
- Implemented building model for this project.
- The building can be viewed in the console.

**Version 2.0:**
- Implemented view and controller for this project.
- The building can be viewed in the GUI.

## Assumptions
1. The elevator operates under ideal conditions, regardless of factors such as damage and extended waiting time when door opening.

## Limitations
- The algorithm for elevator movement is not optimized for real-world scenarios.
